# NBA Analytics for STAT107

This is the repository for the NBA Analytics group in STAT107 F25.

For this project, we seek to answer the following two questions
1. **What contributes best to an aggregate metric of offensive/defensive efficiency relevant to
winning games?**
2. **What wins more games, defense or offense?**

To do so, we will be pulling from these two public data sets
> [NBA Data 2010-2024 by NocturneBear (GitHub)](https://github.com/NocturneBear/NBA-Data-2010-2024)
> 
> [Offical NBA Team & Player Statistics](https://www.nba.com/stats)
